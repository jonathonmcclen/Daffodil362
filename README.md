You are a CIA agent tasked with hunting down the elusive Alabaster White. Various gov't organizations have been chasing Alabaster for years, for various cyber terrorist acts, but the trail has gone cold. However, one fateful day, you get an anonymous email, from someone who claims to be a former follower of Alabaster. The informant says he cant follow a mad man any longer and continues to say "Alabaster is planning something big". Now, it's up to you to stop him before it's too late. Will you succeed? The fate of the world is in your hands.
